								<h3>Goals</h3>
								<p>Our goal is to responsibly equip anyone willing to learn and apply best practices in modern security.</p>

								<hr />
								<h4>Training</h4>
								<p>Having been heavily trained and certified under industry leaders for years, we know what it takes to survive and make a difference in the security community.
								</p>
								<h4>Pragmatism</h4>
								<p>Training without practice environments will lead to a loss of skills.  We heavily believe in being able to practice what you preach.  As we learn new materials, we immediately set out to make our own environments with new and innovative implementations of the material so we can practice.</p>
								<h4>Documentation</h4>
								<p>We document everything. We understand that we don't always have the time to run through scenarios, but we know that we do have time to make proper documentation.  Why?  Because we know that proper documentation saves much more time than it takes to generate.  Taking the time to document what we have learned is one of the secrets to our ability to stay on top of our careers.</p>
								<h4>Testing</h4>
								<p>Fail early, and fail often.  Our tests ensure that we know where our weaknesses are, and that we will learn how to corerct them.  We don't stop at blameless post-mortems.  We fully believe that an environment where you can fail, and get help to close the gap between failure and success is crucial to not succomb to burnout, and is absolutely critical for success and sustainability.</p>
								<h4>Encouragement</h4>
								<p>We have no interest in tearing people down or insults.  Our goals are to be very earnest, very true, and very open.  This does not mean that we don't have difficult conversations, or avoid confrontation.  It simply means that we do not cultivate toxic envionments, but instead fight hard to recognize how much we can all accomplish if we really work together.</p>

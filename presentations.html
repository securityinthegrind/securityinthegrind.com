								<h3>Speakers</h3>
								<p>Timothy Bolton has been speaking professionally for seven years.  His good-natured, presentations are generally well-received and peppered with very practical and relelvant experiences for audience members. More often than not, there will be some sort of custom software written for the presentation that gets given away as a token and means of imparting the core points of the presentation.</p>

								<p>One of the driving forces behind Timothy's talks is the desire to get those around him equipped as quickly as possible, with as deep an understanding as possible. Even traditionally stale topics will end up being fun and engaging.  He has a deep bag of tricks to pull from, and he's always willing to share what he knows.</p>

								<h4>Security in the Grind, <span class="speaking date">April, 2017</span></h4>
								<p>Presented at UMSA's 2017 quarterly webinar, Security in the Grind, a walk through the day-to-day application of security and secure concepts from every stage of the SDLC. This presentation was geared toward Junior to Senior level developers.</p>
								
								<p>This talk is also what inspired the site.</p>

								<hr />
								<h4>Test Driven Development, <span class="speaking date">April, 2015</span></h4>
								<p>Presented at MivaCon 2015. This presentation was geared toward module developers to help introduce <acronym title="Test Driven Development">TDD</acronym> concepts and practices. The Miva Merchant landscape didn't have assertion functionality built into it, so a <acronym title="Test Driven Development">TDD</acronym> and assertion framework and module was built and given away for the developers to use. The talk had many different examples with MivaScript to help demonstrate the utility for <acronym title="Test Driven Development">TDD</acronym> as a point of reference.</p>

								<hr />
								<h4>Writing Secure Code, <span class="speaking date">April, 2015</span></h4>
								<p>Presented at MivaCon 2015 in a breakout session module. This was geared toward following <acronym title="Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard">PCI-DSS</acronym> Compliance within a closed-source application that allowed third party modules.</p>

								<p>Topics included properly handling data validation, sanitizing, masking, data transmission, and solid programming practice to ensure that code was properly tested and reviewed.</p>
								
								<hr />
								<h4>Workflow: An Inquiry into Productivity, <span class="speaking date">April, 2014</span></h4>
								<p>Presented at MivaCon 2014. This presentation went over different workflow states, and showed how to leverage many commonly used tools to create a very easy to use, and robust tool chain. This presentation was geared toward Miva Merchant Module developers.</p>
								
								<hr />
								<h4>Zen and the Art of Miva Merchant Maintenance, <span class="speaking date">April, 2014</span></h4>
								<p>Presented at MivaCon 2014, a talk geared toward Miva Merchant store owners, and Web Admins who dealt with the templating and store maintenance. This presentation went over various aspects of house keeping, and sanity when dealing with changes within a store, as well as solid programming concepts, which were introduced with practical examples to drive the point home of what a clean and maintained eCommerce site can look like on the admin side.</p>
								
								<hr />
								<h4>PCINet Actions, <span class="speaking date">April, 2013</span></h4>
								<p>Presented at MivaCon 2013. This presentation was geared toward store owners and third party developers who wanted to integrate more powerfully with Miva Merchant. The PCINet Actions module was written by me, and leveraged a lot of Miva's under-the-hood power of the store. This allowed for AJAX calls, responsive design, JSON integration (before it was integrated into the language itself), and many other features. Demonstrations of this were given, and at the end of the presentation the module was given away for free.</p>
								
								<hr />
								<h4>Practical AJAX and the PCINet Toolbelt, <span class="speaking date">April, 2012</span></h4>
								<p>Presented at MivaCon 2012, was a talk geared toward store owners, module developers, and web admins. The presentation went over the various features of the PCINet Toolbelt, as well how to pragmatically chain the features together on a site to create powerful responsive actions (generally AJAX, since that was the rage at the time). This talk inspired the PCINet Actions module which I wrote when MivaCon 2012 was over.</p>

								<hr />
								<h4>Store and SMS Integration, <span class="speaking date">April, 2012</span></h4>
								<p>This was the inaugural presentation at MivaCon 2012. The presentation showed how store owners and developers could quickly, and easily integrate with Twilio to use a two-factor authentication to log into their site, use a second-factor to get hacked store back from an attacker, alert when different conversions happened, and message customers to let them know of specials going on.</p>
